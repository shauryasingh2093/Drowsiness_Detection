# Drowsiness_Detection
The Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time computer vision application that identifies driver fatigue based on eye closure patterns using facial landmarks. The project uses Python, OpenCV, and dlib, relying on Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to measure eye openness and alert users when prolonged closure is detected.
